        <p>
            Welcome to my page. Over the next several months, I'll be using this to experiment and learn web development.
        </p>
        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            Since I was a child, I've been intrigued with the idea of making content show up on a computer screen. I would spend hours
            writing stories into word processors, and then making my own webpages or graphic design projects. I'm currently
            an Information Technology professional with about seven years of experience. I've worked various roles in healthcare
            IT, and software support.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've created this site as a vehicle to teach myself more modern web development techniques and hopefully pass on some of
            that knowledge as well. I plan to use Azure Web Services, Git/Github, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and whatever else
            catches my eye. As I work with a technology or process, I will create blogs and tutorials to pass on what I've
            discovered.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not working with technology, I enjoy spending time with my family, reading (science fiction, fantasy, and biographies),
            and watching soccer (Go
            <a href="https://www.atlutd.com">Atlanta United</a>!) and baseball (Go
            <a href="https://www.braves.com">Braves</a>!).
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope that you enjoy the site, and that we learn something together!
        </p>
