        Welcome to my page. Over the next several months, I'll be using this to experiment and learn web development.

    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
        Since I was a child, I've been intriuged with the idea of making content show up on a
        computer screen. I would spend hours writing stories into word processors, and then making my own webpages or graphic design projects. I'm currently an Information Technology professional
        with about seven years of experience. I've worked various roles in healthcare IT, and software support.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've created this site as a vehicle to teach my self more modern web development techniques
        and hopefully pass on some of that knowledge as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I'm not working with technology, I enjoy spending time with my family
        , reading science fiction, fantasy, and biographies, and watching soccer and baseball.I hop
    </p>
    <p>
        I hope that you enjoy the site, and that we learn something together!
